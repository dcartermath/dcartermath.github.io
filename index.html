<h1>Daniel Carter</h1>
<p>I'm currently a math PhD student at Princeton University, primarily interested in graph theory.</p>
<p>I graduated from Princeton with an AB degree in 2023. My senior thesis was "On Hadwiger's Conjecture with Independence Number 2," which corresponds to papers 9, 10, and 11 below.</p>
