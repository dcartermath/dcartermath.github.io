<h1>Daniel Carter</h1>
<p>I'm currently a math PhD candidate at Princeton University, primarily interested in graph theory/discrete math. Currently, I am also interested in automated proof methods. My advisor is <a href="https://web.math.princeton.edu/~mchudnov/">Maria Chudvnosky</a>.</p>
<p>I graduated from Princeton in 2023 with an AB degree in math and a certificate in applications of computing. My senior thesis was "On Hadwiger's Conjecture with Independence Number 2," which corresponds to paper 9 below, plus some currently unsubmitted work, and my junior paper was "Various Variants of Wythoff Nim," paper 8. For these research projects I earned the Middleton Miller '29 Prize in 2023.</p>
