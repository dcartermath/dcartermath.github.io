<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>I was president of the <a href="https://juggling.princeton.edu">Princeton Juggling Club</a> from Spring 2021 to Spring 2022. Our show during the '21-'22 schoolyear was <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DTRPDV9JXk&list=PLOo2IogdV4vCp8lXIAN-X3gbum5oYbBvi">Romeo and Juggliette</a></i>.</p>
<p>I also gave a soft talk on the mathematics of juggling in early 2022, which you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHLoQkEaP4o">watch online here</a>. Please check it out!</p>
<p>I am a problem writer for the <a href="https://jason-shi-f9dm.squarespace.com/">Princeton University Mathematics Competition</a>.</p>
<p>I am also a member of Sympoh Urban Arts Crew, Princeton's breakdancing group. Our show this year, <i>Beat Kill</i> is February 9, 10, and 11. Get tickets at <a href="https://tickets.princeton.edu">tickets.princeton.edu</a>!</p>
